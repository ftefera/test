# **My Last Year**

## Intro

The last year (and some change) of my life has been a total roller coaster. In October of 2021, two weeks before my birthday, I found out I was 6 weeks pregnant with my son. Although we were excited for this new chapter of our lives,we were in complete shock. We had just invested a lot of money into starting our business and did not know how we were going to afford bringing a new life into this world. Money was tight during my pregnancy and my boyfriend wasn't able to enjoy the small moments with me because he had to work a lot but we were able to make it work. I appreciate all the long nights and everything he did to make sure our son would have everything he wants and needs. 

Our son is our everything! I love being able to watch him grow and discover new things. I hold so much pride in being a mother and knowing I brought a life into this world just blows my mind. Their is nothing more important to me than my family. Everything I do is for my family's well-being. That is why I joined YearUp.

## What excites me about my YearUp journey

1. I am excited to re-start my career.
  After not working for a few years, Yearup has kind of given me a refresher on how it feels to be back in the work field.

2. Financial stability
   Completing this program and reciving my Project Management Certificate will set me up to find a job that will pay me a decent wage. YearUp also connects us with people that can help us move forward and advance in our careers. Inturn, this will give me the ablity to provide a better more stable life for my family.
   
3. Internship with Providence
   As of Monday, I found out that I will being interning at Providence Health & Services. I am excited and greatful for this opportunity! I know this will open a lot of opportunities in my career.
   
## YearUp Accomplishments

My greatest acconplishement in this program would be reciving an internship with the qualifications I needed. My first conversation with Nate about internship I told him that I would really like a position that was remote. He let me know from the beginning that I would need to work hard in my classes, keep up with expenctaions and get high marks in my classes. I was able to accomplish all these tasks and it paid off in my internship position.
